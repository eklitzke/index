Regular Expressions
===================
* add support for regular expressions

Front End
=========
* add syntax highlighting
* link to github (where appropriate)

Bugs
====
* make search results be returned in a deterministic order
* adjacent results in searches need to be merged
* index data should be in a deterministic order, for rsync

Performance/Correctness
=======================
* use a threadpool in cindex rather than creating lots of short-lived threads
* prevent cindex from blocking threads on rotation

Miscellaneous
=============
* index github
* add logging -- this is important for perf tuning
* use std::binary_search
* add a way to shutdown the server process gracefully while using massif
* add more file extensions
