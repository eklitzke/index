Cleanups
========

The code for getting context out of a file is a mess... it does a
bunch of 1-byte backwards seeks instead of seeking more and buffering,
and does this for each matched line, even when matches are
adjacent. Profiling indicates that this is not taking up too much
time, but it still ought to be fixed.
