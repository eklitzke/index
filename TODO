Front End
=========

Bugs
====
* make search results be returned in a deterministic order
* adjacent results in searches need to be merged
* index data should be in a deterministic order, for rsync
* use a threadpool in cindex rather than creating lots of short-lived threads
* prevent cindex from blocking threads on rotation
* we should do UTF-8 detection, rather than a hard list of file exts
* add a way to bundle file contents with the index

Miscellaneous
=============
* index github
