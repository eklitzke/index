<h2>The Index</h2>
This is an implementation of &ldquo;fgrep&rdquo; running on a
single &ldquo;small&rdquo; EC2 instance. It's indexing all of
the code checked in as part of
the Linux 3.5.2 kernel, more than 14,000,000 lines of code.
<p>
  The basic idea for this implementation is inspired
  by <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html</a>,
  although this implementation is more limited (it does not
  support regexes). Regex support should be coming real soon
  though.
  
  <h2>Implementation Notes &amp; Buzzwords</h2>
      The implementation uses a custom
      <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/">SSTable</a>
      implementation written in C++,
      using <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview">Protocol
      Buffers</a>. The search index is mmap'ed, but not otherwise
      loaded into memory; likewise, there is no caching done on any
      queries (other than the usual page caching that happens on
      Linux). The search index is heavily sharded and multi-threaded,
      using C++11 threads. The sharding logic is mostly what allows
      the backend to return so quickly (i.e. the multi-threading
      doesn't help on this EC2 instance, since small instances only
      have one CPU). The sharding level is fairly high (right now,
      there are more than 100 total shards), so generally the speedup
      on a multi-core system would be about proportional to the number
      of cores on that system. On my dual-core consumer grade laptop,
      even pathological queries generally return in under 20
      milliseconds.
      <p>
      The frontend is written in Python
      (using <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/">tornado</a>), and
      communicates to the backend using a custom asynchronous RPC
      protocol. The protocol is based around Protocol Buffers. The
      client uses tornado async capabilites and the backend is written
      using <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/asio">boost::asio</a>. For
      fun I made the entire frontend run asynchronously using
      tornado's <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/documentation/web.html#tornado.web.asynchronous">asynchronous</a>
      decorator, which means that a single frontend process/thread can
      service multiple requests simultaneously, if it's blocked on the
      backend.
      <p>
      The search index and the RPC protocol both use Google's
      excellent <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy/">Snappy</a>
      library for compression.
