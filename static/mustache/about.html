      This is an implementation of &ldquo;fgrep&rdquo; running on a
      64-bit <em>micro</em> EC2 instance. It's indexing the more than
      14 million lines of code in the Linux 3.4.4 kernel (including
      all drivers, auxilliary code, headers, tools, etc.).
      <p>
      The basic idea for this implementation is inspired
      by <a href="http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html">http://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp4.html</a>,
      although this implementation is more limited (it does not support
      regexes). Regex support should be coming real soon though (as
      well as searching for 1 and 2 character queries).
      <p>
      The implementation uses a custom
      <a href="http://www.igvita.com/2012/02/06/sstable-and-log-structured-storage-leveldb/">SSTable</a>
      implementation written in C++, using <tt>mmap</tt> and Protocol
      Buffers. The search index is heavily sharded and multi-threaded,
      using C++11 threads. The sharding logic is mostly what allows
      the backend to return so quickly (i.e. the multi-threading
      doesn't help on this EC2 instance, since micro instances only
      have one CPU). The sharding level is fairly high (right now,
      there are about 80 total shards), so generally the speedup on a
      multi-core system would be about proportional to the number of
      cores on that system. On my four-core laptop, even pathological
      queries generally return in under 20 milliseconds.
      <p>
      The frontend is written in Python (using tornado), and
      communicates to the backend using a custom asynchronous RPC
      protocol. The protcol is based around Protocol Buffers, and the
      client uses tornado async capabilites and the backend is written
      using boost::asio. Since the entire frontend is fully async, I'm
      using tornado's async decorator and only running a single
      frontend thread/process.
      <p>
      The Javascript stuff is Zepto + Mustache.js.
